# Where to download
# ---------------------

Only source code is available here on github. To download pre-built nape you should visit my
homepage, with new versions currently being uploaded by version to http://deltaluca.me.uk/napenew

# ---------------------
# Which build to use
# ---------------------

For general development purposes ALWAYS use the debug builds; these are not much slower than the
release builds but provide you with a large amount of error detection to ensure you're using nape
correctly.

You should only use release builds when you are absolutely sure you have no nape errors, and are
releasing a final product. Any uncaught errors will either lead to bad behaviour and/or flash player
exceptions.

If you are one of those lucky people helping me track down bugs, use the assertion builds. Even
with the limited information avaiable from .swcs, assertion builds provide much more useful
information to track down a bug.

# ---------------------
# compiling from source
# ---------------------

Dependancies:
    haxe
    hxcpp (for c++ compilation)
    caxe
    flib (if you want to compile AS3 nape .swcs)
    
flib and caxe may be found from my other github repositories, and may also be compiled from source.

The supplied Makefile should work fine under unix systems, commands will be identical from windows
command line.

# ---------------------
# haXe compiler flags
# ---------------------

for assertion builds; use flags
    -D NAPE_ASSERT --no-inline -debug
if compiling to AS3 nape .swcs you must instead use
    -D NAPE_ASSERT -D NAPE_NO_INLINE
as some inlining (for flib properties) is necessary for a functioning .swc

for debug builds; use no extra flags

for release builds; use flags
    -D NAPE_RELEASE_BUILD
