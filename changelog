Bug Fixes:
    Ensure a second velocity update is performed on CCD contacts so that
    friction is correctly computed. Effects CCD collisions between bouncy
    objects mostly.

    Fix bug in monotone decomposition, specifically in Edge::edge_lt when comparing
    edges that are weakly-intersecting with one vertex contained by the other line.
    Add speculative handling of other degenerate cases in this method; very difficult
    to come up with a specific test case that will invoke them, but logically they
    are correct handlers.
