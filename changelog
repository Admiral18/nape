GeomPoly:
    forward_iterator renamed forwardIterator
    backwards_iterator renamed backwardsIterator
    skip_forward renamed skipForward
    skip_backwards renamed skipBackwards
    simple_decomposition renamed simpleDecomposition
    convex_decomposition renamed convexDecomposition
    triangular_decomposition renamed triangularDecomposition
    monotone_decomposition renamed monotoneDecomposition

    constructor, copy methods changed so that the current head of GeomPoly
    will point to the first vertex given.

AngleJoint:
    slack property removed, replaced with isSlack method

DistanceJoint
    slack property removed, replaced with isSlack method

CbType:
    Fixed bug so that constraints list correctly only tracks Constraints
    that have been added to a Space.

Vec2:
    fromPoint now included for nme target, not just flash
    Added Vec2::normalise and Vec2::unit methods

AABB:
    fromRect now included for nme target, not just flash

Mat23:
    set, setAs, reset methods now returns reference to 'this' instead of nothing.

NapeList's:
    removed debug errors when modifying a list whilst iterating. Not because doing
    so is safe (or ever has been), but because I realised that if iteration over a
    list is terminated early then the iterator will not be removed from the tracker
    and spurious errors were possible as well as potential GC issues.

    foreach and filter method now returns reference to 'this' instead of nothing
    filter method changed so that returning 'true' marks element for removal,
    instead of false. !!! <-- beware. This is changed to be more consistent with other API's.

UserConstraint:
    __destroy method to be overriden, renamed as __broken. (And fixed bug where it wouldn't
    have ever even been called :P)
