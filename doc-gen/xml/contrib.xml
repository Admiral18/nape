	<text> Every and all donations to nape help keep me motivated to work on it as much as I reasonably can (without failing my degree, and without starving myself!) This list will be kept as up to date as I can do and I will always ask if someone does not want their name listed and list them via (anonymous) instead. </text><br/><br/>

	<indent>
		<text>I got bored one day, so I thought about what sort of information can actually be gathered about the donations overall from the graphics and knowing the total number of donations. And it turns out we can actually compute lower and upper bounds for both the total amount donated, as well as the average donation in each value range</text><br/><br/>
		<text>The bounds on the average donations as computed on public information alone are:</text><br/>
		<text>£(4.16,4.61], £(5,25], £(25,77], £(77,168], £(168,299], £(0,0], £(465,661]</text><br/><br/>
		<text>And bounds on total donated amount is: £(949.10,1874.25] &lt;-- that's a big range of possible values lol.</text>
